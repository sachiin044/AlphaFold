# 🧬 Mini AlphaFold – Small-Scale Protein Structure & Drug Discovery AI

A lightweight, Streamlit-powered AI system for **protein family classification**, inspired by DeepMind’s AlphaFold but optimized for **smaller datasets**, **fewer parameters**, and **accessible compute environments**.

---

## 1️⃣ Project Overview

**Mini AlphaFold** is designed to bring protein structure–related AI capabilities to researchers, students, and developers without access to supercomputers.  
Instead of tackling full 3D folding like AlphaFold, this project focuses on **Protein Family Classification** using amino acid sequences.

Key highlights:
- Runs locally or on modest cloud instances.
- Built on **transfer learning** from pre-trained protein language models (e.g., ESM-2, ProtBERT).
- Interactive **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.

---

## 2️⃣ Motivation

AlphaFold’s breakthrough in protein structure prediction earned global recognition, but its **high computational requirements** limit accessibility for smaller research teams.

This project aims to **democratize protein AI** by:
- Using **lightweight deep learning models** (≤50M parameters).
- Narrowing the focus to **specific, high-impact bioinformatics tasks**.
- Providing an **easy-to-use web interface** for fast experimentation.
